The main.py script is where our main code is running. Here we are using Deep sorting
by pytorch and object detection by YOLOV8 for detecting and counting cattle.
We learnt how to use yolov8 in this github and youtube video:
https://github.com/computervisioneng/train-yolov8-custom-dataset-step-by-step-guide/blob/master/google_colab/TrainYolov8CustomDataset.ipynb
But we did not get the result we was looking for, because the boxes around cattle was flashing, so we instead write a code where we included tracking from
this github:
