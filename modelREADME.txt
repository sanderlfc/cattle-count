In the model.py we were first loading the yolov8.yaml model from this github:
https://github.com/computervisioneng/train-yolov8-custom-dataset-step-by-step-guide/blob/master/google_colab/TrainYolov8CustomDataset.ipynb
After that we decided to shift out the model with the first best.pt model we had made on our own, do get better training result.
We are also declaring some parameters in this script.
We were trying out different parameters to see if the model could get improved.
